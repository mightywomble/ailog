# AI Log Viewer - Multi-Host Log Analysis Platform

A comprehensive, modern web application for viewing and analyzing system logs from `/var/log` and `journalctl` across both **local** and **remote** servers. This advanced platform combines real-time log viewing, powerful search capabilities, AI-powered analysis, and proactive alerting in a sleek, responsive interface designed for developers and system administrators.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

This application is designed for use on a trusted, internal development network only. It runs commands with `sudo` on local and remote machines and provides access to potentially sensitive log data.

**DO NOT expose this application to the public internet.** Doing so would create a significant security risk. You must ensure that passwordless SSH key-based authentication is set up correctly and that the principle of least privilege is followed.

## üõ† Installation & Setup

### System Requirements
* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian 11+ / CentOS 8+ (systemd-based distributions)
* **Python:** 3.8 or higher
* **Memory:** 512MB+ RAM (1GB+ recommended for multiple hosts)
* **Network:** Internal network access to monitored hosts
* **SSH:** Key-based authentication configured for remote hosts

### Prerequisites

* A Linux server to host the AI Log Viewer application
* Non-root user with sudo privileges (we'll use `david` in examples - replace with your username)
* SSH key-based authentication configured for remote host access
* OpenAI API key for AI analysis features (optional but recommended)
* Discord webhook URL for notifications (optional)

#### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

Update your package list and install Python, pip, and the virtual environment module.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3.12-venv -y
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Project Directory and Clone Repo

Create a directory for the application and clone the project repository into it.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/code
cd ~/code
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```

#### Step 3: Create Python Virtual Environment & Install Requirements

It's best practice to run a Python application in a virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
The project includes a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies:

**requirements.txt**
```
Flask>=2.3.3
Werkzeug>=2.3.7
openai>=1.3.0
requests>=2.31.0
APScheduler>=3.10.4
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Configure Passwordless `sudo` Access

For the application to read logs, the user running it needs passwordless `sudo` access **for the specific commands required**.

**This** configuration must be applied to every machine **the Log Viewer will access (including `localhost` and all remote servers).**

1.  On each server, open the sudoers file for editing using `visudo`. This is the safest way to edit this file.

    ```bash
    sudo visudo
    ```

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line. Remember to replace `david` with the username that will be used for SSH/local access on that specific machine.

    ```
    # Allow the 'david' user to run specific log-reading commands without a password
    david ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ls -p /var/log, /usr/bin/stat -c %s %Y /var/log/*, /usr/bin/tail -n 500 /var/log/*, /usr/bin/zcat /var/log/*.gz, /usr/bin/journalctl --field _SYSTEMD_UNIT, /usr/bin/journalctl -u * -n 500 --no-pager
    ```

3.  Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

#### Step 5: Set Up the Systemd Service

Create a `systemd` service on the main Log Viewer server to ensure the application runs automatically on boot.

1.  Create a new service file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/logviewer.service
    ```

2.  Paste the following configuration into the file. Crucially, replace `david` with your username and `your-repo-name` with your project's directory name.

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Flask Log Viewer Application
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=david
    Group=www-data
    WorkingDirectory=/home/david/code/your-repo-name
    # Use 'debug=False' for production stability with the scheduler
    ExecStart=/home/david/code/your-repo-name/venv/bin/python3 /home/david/code/your-repo-name/app.py
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

3.  Save and close the file.

#### Step 6: Start and Enable the Service

Reload the `systemd` daemon, then start and enable the service.
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start logviewer
sudo systemctl enable logviewer
```

#### Step 7: Verify the Service is Running

Check the status of the service to ensure it's active.
```bash
sudo systemctl status logviewer
```
You should see output indicating the service is `active (running)`.
